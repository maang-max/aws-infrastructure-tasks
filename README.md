# AWS Infrastructure with Terraform

This repository contains Terraform configurations and scripts for deploying and managing AWS infrastructure components. The project implements infrastructure as code (IaC) principles to ensure reproducibility, scalability, and maintainability.

## Project Overview

This project covers the following AWS infrastructure tasks:

1. **Infrastructure Management**
   - VPC deployment with multiple subnets across availability zones
   - EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB)
   - Security group configurations
   - Cost and performance optimization

2. **Monitoring & Incident Management**
   - CloudWatch monitoring for EC2, ALB, and system logs
   - CloudWatch Alarms for critical conditions
   - CloudTrail logs for security auditing
   - Incident simulation and analysis

3. **Automation & Scripting**
   - Infrastructure deployment using Terraform
   - Operational task scripts (backups, security settings, scaling)
   - Version-controlled configurations

4. **Security & Cloud Operations**
   - IAM roles and policies with least privilege principle
   - Data encryption at rest and in transit
   - Cloud cost optimization strategies

5. **Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity**
   - EBS snapshots and AMI backups
   - RTO/RPO objectives and disaster recovery planning
   - Failover testing and validation
