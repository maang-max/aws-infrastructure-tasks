# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the AWS infrastructure to ensure data protection, access control, and compliance with security best practices.

## IAM Roles and Policies

### Principle of Least Privilege

All IAM roles and policies follow the principle of least privilege, granting only the permissions necessary for specific tasks:

- **EC2 Instance Roles**: Limited to required AWS service access
- **User Roles**: Segregated by function (admin, developer, operator)
- **Service Roles**: Scoped to specific service requirements

### IAM Best Practices

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
- Regular rotation of access keys
- IAM policies attached to groups or roles, not individual users
- Use of IAM Access Analyzer to identify unintended resource access

## Network Security

### VPC Configuration

- VPC with public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones
- Internet-facing resources in public subnets only
- Application and database tiers in private subnets
- Network ACLs as an additional security layer

### Security Groups

- Restrictive security groups allowing only necessary traffic
- No direct SSH access from the internet
- Application traffic restricted to specific ports
- Internal traffic limited to required communication paths

## Data Protection

### Encryption at Rest

- EBS volumes encrypted using AWS KMS
- S3 buckets with server-side encryption enabled
- RDS instances with encryption enabled
- KMS keys with appropriate key rotation policies

### Encryption in Transit

- HTTPS/TLS for all external communications
- Internal traffic secured where applicable
- Certificate management through AWS Certificate Manager
- Regular certificate rotation

## Monitoring and Logging

### CloudTrail

- CloudTrail enabled for all AWS API calls
- Logs stored in dedicated S3 bucket with appropriate retention
- Log file validation enabled
- Multi-region logging

### CloudWatch

- Metric collection for all resources
- Alarms for suspicious activities
- Log retention policies aligned with compliance requirements
- Dashboard for security monitoring

### AWS Config

- Configuration recording enabled
- Compliance rules implemented
- Automated remediation for specific non-compliant resources

## Incident Response

### Detection

- Automated alerting for security events
- Regular log analysis
- Anomaly detection using CloudWatch

### Response Procedures

1. Identify and assess the security incident
2. Contain the incident to prevent further damage
3. Eradicate the cause of the incident
4. Recover affected systems
5. Document lessons learned and update procedures

## Compliance

### Regulatory Compliance

- Infrastructure designed to support compliance requirements
- Regular compliance assessments
- Documentation of controls

### Security Standards

- Alignment with AWS Well-Architected Framework
- Implementation of CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark
- Regular security assessments

## Cost Optimization with Security

- Right-sizing of security resources
- Automated security processes to reduce operational overhead
- Balancing security controls with operational efficiency

## Security Updates and Patching

- Automated patching for EC2 instances
- Regular updates to AMIs
- Vulnerability scanning and remediation

## Recommendations for Future Enhancements

1. Implement AWS GuardDuty for threat detection
2. Deploy AWS Shield for DDoS protection
3. Consider AWS WAF for web application protection
4. Implement AWS Security Hub for centralized security management
